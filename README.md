## Introduction
In this thesis, I explore the use of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) neural networks as variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wavefunctions. This research is based on the article by G. Carleo and M. Troyer published by Science under the name "Solving the quantum many-body problem using artificial neural networks".

For more information, please refer to the [article](https://www.sciencemag.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2302) by G. Carleo and M. Troyer.

## Methodology
I develop a framework for training RBM wavefunctions using quantum Monte Carlo methods and gradient-based optimization algorithms. The goal is to find the optimal RBM parameters that minimize the energy of the quantum system under study. In this case, the Transverse Field Ising model in 1D.

## Results
I present the results of applying the RBM wavefunctions to the TFI model. I analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the RBM ansatz compared to the exact analytical results.

## Conclusion
Based on the results obtained, I discuss the potential of RBM neural networks as a viable approach for representing quantum many-body wavefunctions. I also highlight future research directions and possible improvements to the methodology.
